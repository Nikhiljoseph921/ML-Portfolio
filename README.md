  📌 About
This portfolio was created as part of my MSc in Data Science coursework. It contains structured Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating practical knowledge of ML and DL concepts. Each project includes:

📊 Data Preprocessing & Visualization:

Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding

Feature scaling and transformation techniques

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices

🏗 Model Training, Evaluation, and Improvement:

Training machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning

Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, RMSE, F1-score, and AUC-ROC

Model interpretability using feature importance and SHAP values

🔍 Feature Engineering & Selection:

Creating new features using domain knowledge

Reducing dimensionality with PCA and feature selection techniques

📝 Experiment Tracking and Insights:

Logging results for different models and hyperparameters

Comparing baseline models with optimized versions

Generating business insights from model outputs

Each project provides a hands-on learning experience, ensuring deployment readiness for real-world applications.

This makes it more detailed and informative! Let me know if you need any refinements. 🚀
